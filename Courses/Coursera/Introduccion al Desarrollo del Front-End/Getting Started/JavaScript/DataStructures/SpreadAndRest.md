# Using SPREAD AND REST
In this reading, you'll learn how to join arrays, objects using the rest operator. You will also discover how to use the spread operator to:

 Add new members to arrays without using the push() method,

Convert a string to an array and

Copy either an object or an array into a separate obje

**Recall that the push() and pop() methods are used to add and remove items from the end of an array.**

## Join arrays, objects using the rest operator
Using the spread operator, it's easy to concatenate arrays:
```JS
const fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'plum']
const berries = ['blueberry', 'strawberry']
const fruitsAndBerries = [...fruits, ...berries] // concatenate
console.log(fruitsAndBerries); // outputs a single array
```
Here's the result:  
```JS
['apple', 'pear', 'plum', 'blueberry', 'strawberry']
```
It's also easy to join objects:  
```JS
const flying = { wings: 2 }
const car = { wheels: 4 }
const flyingCar = {...flying, ...car}
console.log(flyingCar) // {wings: 2, wheels: 4}
```
## Add new members to arrays without using the push() method
Here's how to use the spread operator to easily add one or more members to an existing array:
```js
let veggies = ['onion', 'parsley'];
veggies = [...veggies, 'carrot', 'beetroot'];
console.log(veggies);
```
Here's the output:
```js
['onion', 'parsley', 'carrot', 'beetroot']
```
## Convert a string to an array using the spread operator
Given a string, it's easy to spread it out into separate array items:
```js
const greeting = "Hello";
const arrayOfChars = [...greeting];
console.log(arrayOfChars); // Â ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```
## Copy either an object or an array into a separate one
Here's how to copy an object into a completely separate object, using the spread operator.
```js
const car1 = {
    speed: 200,
    color: 'yellow'
}
const car 2 = {...car1}

car1.speed = 201

console.log(car1.speed, car2.speed)
```
The output is 201, 200.

You can copy an array into a completely separate array, also using the spread operator, like this:
```js
const fruits1 = ['apples', 'pears']
const fruits2 = [...fruits1]
fruits1.pop()
console.log(fruits1, "not", fruits2)
```
This time, the output is:
```js
['apples'] 'not' ['apples','pears']
```
