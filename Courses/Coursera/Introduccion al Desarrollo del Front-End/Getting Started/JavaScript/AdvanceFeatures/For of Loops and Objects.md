# For of Loops and Objects

To begin, it's important to know that a for of loop cannot work on an object directly, since an object is not iterable. For example:

```js
const car = {
    speed: 100,
    color: "blue"
}

for(prop of car) {
    console.log(prop)
}
```
Running the above code snippet will throw the following error:  
```js
Uncaught TypeError: car is not iterable
```
 Contrary to objects, arrays are iterable. For example:  
 ```js
 const colors = ['red','orange','yellow']
for (var color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
```
This time, , the output is as follows:
```js
red
orange
yellow
```
Luckily, you can use the fact that a for of loop can be run on arrays to loop over objects.

But how?

Before you can properly answer this question, you first need to review three built-in methods: `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`.

## Built-in methods
### The `Object.keys()` method
The `Object.keys()` method receives an object as its parameter. Remember, this object is **the object you want to loop over**. It's still too early to explain how you'll loop over the object itself; for now, focus on the returned array of properties when you call the `Object.keys()` method.

Here's an example of running the `Object.keys()` method on a brand new car2 object:
```js
const car2 = {
    speed: 200,
    color: "red"
}
console.log(Object.keys(car2)); // ['speed','color']
```
So, when I run `Object.keys()` and pass it my car2 object, the returned value is an array of strings, where each string is a property key of the properties contained in my car2 object

### The` Object.values()` method
Another useful method is `Object.values()`:
```js
const car3 = {
    speed: 300,
    color: "yellow"
}
console.log(Object.values(car3)); // [300, 'yellow']
```

### The `Object.entries()` method
Finally, there's another useful method, `Object.entries()`, which returns an array listing both the keys and the values.  

```js
const car4 = {
    speed: 400,
    color: 'magenta'
}
console.log(Object.entries(car4));
```
What gets returned from the invocation of the `Object.entries()` method is the following:  
```js
[ ['speed', 400], ['color', 'magenta'] ]
```
To summarise, you learned that you can loop over arrays using the for of loop.  You also learned that you can extract object's keys, values, or both, using the `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()` and `Object.entries()` syntax.

### Examples
You now have all the ingredients that you need to loop over any object's own property keys and values.

Here's a very simple example of doing just that:

```js
var clothingItem = {
    price: 50,
    color: 'beige',
    material: 'cotton',
    season: 'autumn'
}

for( const key of Object.keys(clothingItem) ) {
    console.log(key, ":", clothingItem[key])
}
```
The trickiest part to understand in this syntax is probably the *clothingItem[key]*.

Luckily, this is not too hard to comprehend, especially since you've already covered the concept previously when you were learning how to access an object's member using the brackets notation. 

Recall that you also learned how you can dynamically access a property name.

To revisit this concept and show a practical demo of how that works, let's code a function declaration that randomly assigns either the string speed or the string color to a variable name, and then build an object that has only two keys: a speed key and a color key.

After this setup, you will be able to dynamically access either one of those properties on a brand new drone object, using the brackets notation.

Here's the example's code:
```js
function testBracketsDynamicAccess() {
  var dynamicKey;
  if(Math.random() > 0.5) {
    dynamicKey = "speed";
   }else{
     dynamicKey = "color";
   }

    var drone = {
      speed: 15,
      color: "orange"
    }

    console.log(drone[dynamicKey]);
}
testBracketsDynamicAccess();
```

This example might feel a bit convoluted, but its purpose is to demo the fact that you're getting either one or the other value from an object's key, based on the string that got assigned to the dynamicKey variable, and accessed without issues, using the brackets notation.

Feel free to run the` testBracketsDynamicAccess()` function a few times, and you'll notice that sometimes the value that gets output is 15, and sometimes it's orange, although I'm always accessing the *drone[dynamicKey]* key. Since the value of the dynamicKey is populated on the `Math.random()` invocation, sometimes that expression evaluates to *drone["speed"]*, and other times that expression evaluates to *drone["color"]*.
