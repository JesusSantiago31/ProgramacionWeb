Pure.css is another library for building user interfaces. While it doesn't have as many features as Bootstrap, it is designed to be minimal in file size. Smaller file sizes improve loading times for web pages as there is less data to transfer from the web server. If your next project is focused on minimal loading time, this library is worth considering.
