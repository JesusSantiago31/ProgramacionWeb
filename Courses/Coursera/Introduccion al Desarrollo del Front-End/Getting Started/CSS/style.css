/*Differents types of selectors*/
/*Element Selectors*/
/*The element selector allows developers to select HTML elements based on their element type.*/
p {
    color: #065ce7;

/*ID Selectors*/
/*The ID selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element. Since the id is unique within a webpage,
 it allows the developer to select a specific element for styling. ID selectors are prefixed with a
  # character.*/
#ids{
    color:#e70606;
}

/*Class Selector*/
/*Ele  ments can also be selected based on the class attribute applied to them. The CSS rule has been 
applied to all elements with the specified class name. The class selector is prefixed with a 
. character*/

}

/*Element with class selector*/

 selecting the CSS class or ID.*/

another selector.*/
